Disease diagnosis today is often late, unreliable, and expensive, leading to ineffective treatments, decreased quality of life, and premature death. In this project, we developed a novel end-to-end software platform to accurately diagnose 18 diseases, including Lung Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Concussion, Laryngeal Cancer, Alzheimer's, and more. Our novel approach utilizes voice dysphonia, a powerful biomarker, to diagnose disease using a three-stage supervised machine-learning pipeline. The platform extracts dysphonic features to determine linear and non-linear measures, relaying the information to a tree-based binary decomposition framework with optimized heterogeneous stacking ensembles at the nodes. Trained with over 95000 unique voice samples, the algorithms classifies not only the diagnostic affliction but also its stage. The traversal complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the backend architecture, allows for the platform to be highly expandable with the capability to rapidly incorporate new diseases without the need to extensively restructure the backend. The blockchain implementation establishes a decentralized, immutable record of patient data and increases accessibility across supported platforms through strict authorization procedures. A mobile application for iOS and Android, a web application, and call-in diagnosis system were developed and tested, providing universal accessibility to the diagnostic system, even in low-resource settings. Currently, the platform holds an average accuracy of 97.6% (obtained via k-fold cross evaluation) for all 18 diseases - a significant improvement over current diagnostic methods. This project presents a first-of-its-kind diagnostic software capable of diagnosing multiple diseases in an accurate and scalable manner.
Note:
This particular file set only holds the algorithm backend portion of VoiceEDx. The database system along with the web app code is held on another repository. The algorithm's function to take an input as a voice sample and then return a predicted diagnosis along with a few other measures. The algorithm consists of 6 segments with the primary one being the MultiVoiceAnalysisWindows class. Then there are 3 levels of decomposing classifiers from High-level, to Mid-level, to Low-level. Then there are secondary and confirmation classifiers. Note that this system has to have WEKA downloaded in order to work properly along with a few WEKA add-ons
